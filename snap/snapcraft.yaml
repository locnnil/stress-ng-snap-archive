summary: stress-ng will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways
description: |
  stress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip hardware
  issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating system bugs that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard.
  Use stress-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot on poorly
  designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.
